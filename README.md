## Versions
This demo is maintained for the current long term support and the newest version for Contao.

See the [Contao release plan][contao-releaseplan] for details. Each demo version has a separate branch in this Git 
repository.

## Installation
The demo website can be installed alongside Contao, either through the Contao Manager or with [Composer][composer] on 
the command line.

### Via contao-manager
When installing a fresh Contao application, select Contao Theme and upload following demo file:

![Select the contao theme option and upload the file](/docs/_images/install/cm/selectTheme.png "Select Theme")


Type in
> contao-thememanager/demo

within the searchbar (**B**) and install it from the recommended themes using the latest version (5.2)

or

select the option 'Contao Theme' and upload the following file

| Contao Version |           Download            |
|----------------|:-----------------------------:|
| `5.2`          | [ðŸ’¾](/docs/demo/ctm-demo.zip) |


![Check the dependencies and install the theme](/docs/_images/install/cm/dependencies.png "Composer dependencies")
Install the theme and follow the usual contao setup


![This demo does not have an admin account thus you can create one in the setup wizard](/docs/_images/install/cm/account.png "Creating an account")
This demo does not deliver an admin account, so you can set your own credentials


### Via composer
This repository functions as a _Composer project_. You can install a full Contao application and this demo using the 
`create-project` command. We're assuming here you are familiar with the command line and Composer and have a functioning 
PHP and webserver setup.

1. Run `composer create-project contao-thememanager/demo:5.2 your-new-website`
2. Connect the database e.g. through `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env.local` file.
3. Import the database backup using `php vendor/bin/contao-console contao:backup:restore`
4. Create an admin account using `php vendor/bin/contao-console contao:user:create`
